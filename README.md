# test_drive

A beginner Flutter project.

## Summary

This project is the result of following the [Flutter Docs "Getting Started" Codelabs Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#7). This is my first time using Flutter, and basically my first time using GitHub, so please forgive any errors/mistakes... I will only get better from here.

This project is a responsive, multi-platform application that will randomly generate two word "ideas", and allow the user to save their favorite ideas to a seperate "favorites" page.

## In this Project, I practiced:
  - State Mangement
  - Responsive Design
  - Conditional Rendering
  - UI/UX Design

## Reflection

I wanted to do this project to learn more about mobile development. The idea of a development platform that allows you to create cross-platform applications from one codebase was new and exciting for me, and I wanted to learn more about Flutter to see if it would be something I am interested in. After this short project, it's too early to formulate a definitive opinion, but my early impression is that it felt a bit clunky, and I had trouble with the cleanliness of my code. I'm unsure if this was due to my unfamiliarity with Dart (which was a bit confusing at first, although I did quickly realize some similarities between Dart and JavaScript) or with Flutter itself. I think I'll continue learning more about Flutter for now, and I hope my next app will be more impressive.
