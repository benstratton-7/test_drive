# test_drive

A beginner Flutter project.

## Summary

This project is the result of following the [flutter docs "Getting Started" codelabs tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#7). This is my first time using flutter, and basically my first time using GitHub, so please forgive any errors/mistakes... I will only get better from here.

This project is a responsive, multi-platform application that will randomly generate two word "ideas", and allow the user to save their favorite ideas to a seperate "favorites" page.

## In this Project, I practiced:
  - State Mangement
  - Responsive Design
  - Conditional Rendering
  - UI/UX Design
